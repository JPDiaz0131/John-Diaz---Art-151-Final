  <p>A Galaxy Far Far Away, Minimalized - by John Diaz <br><br>
      A simple collection of sketches meant to represent the various planets of Star Wars drawn in a minimalist style. The sketches are desinged to utilize basic geometiric shapes and standard rgb colors in order to create simplistic depiction of various Star Wars planets such as Tatooine or Bespin in a way that is both recognizable and easy on the eyes. The layout of the exhibit is simply a layout of all 10 sketches on a pure black background, which not only allows the bright and simple colors of each piece to really stand out, but also gives the allusion of traveling in deep space, a fitting environment for the kind of work I am presenting. The major inspiration behind this collection is the various sticker and poster designs of different Star Wars people or planets that I would find while online shopping. The simplicity of the designs and the brightness of the color scheme managed to appeal to me very much.  <br><br>
